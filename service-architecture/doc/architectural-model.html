  <h1>Architectural Foundations</h1>
  <p>At its core, Eucalyptus is a distributed system of web-services for
    provisioning collections of related virtual resources using actual physical
    resources. This function has a formative influence on the architecture of
    the system. The Eucalyptus web-services coordinate to realize a logical
    model that users specify through API operations by manipulating a variety of
    distributed physical resources (compute hosts, networks, storage devices,
    etc.).</p>
  <p>The characteristics of this role, the involved resources and their
    interactions are major influences on the system's' architecture. These can
    be classified:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Logical Model: Virtual Resources</strong> the
      collection of related logical entities which the user of the system uses
      to express the desired outcome.
    <li><strong>The Information Model: Ground Truth & Physical
        Resources</strong> the authoritative source of state information about some
      resource or relationship. Implementation and operational realities have
      lead us to co-locate ground truth with the physical resource. This feeds
      back into the logical model used internally but is not otherwise visible
      to users of the system.
    <li><strong>The State Model: Resource Lifecycle & Interactions</strong>
      Each resource has a set of logical states and transitions which a resource
      goes through as the system works to actuate changes to physical resources.
      Similarly, logical resources also have long-lasting (and possibly
      stateful) interactions that can manifest as physical changes in the
      system.
    <li><strong>The Control/Concurrency Model: Service
        Architecture</strong> Eucalyptus is organized as a tiered ensemble of web
      services. Service components "plug into" a universal naming and messaging
      substrate software that separates (abstracts away) communication and
      location functions throughout the ensemble. All Eucalyptus software
      components, fundamentally, use this bus-style architecture to communicate.
    
  </ul>
  <p>
    Taken together, these determine abstract model of the system, its <em>interfaces</em>,
    <em>interactions</em>, and <em>behaviours</em>. Moreover, there are
    implications on the physical/deployment model of the system's services which
    follow from ground-truth living at the physical resource. The remaining
    sections elaborate on these influences and their consequences.
  </p>
  <h2 style="clear: both">Logical Resource Model</h2>
  <img src="logical-model.png" style="float: right"
    title="Logical Resource Model" />
  <p>
    The logical resource model determines the vocabulary that is used to do work
    using Eucalyptus. This vocabulary has nouns (virtual machine instance,
    volume, bucket, etc.) and verbs (create, add, terminate, etc.) which are
    expressed in (and intertwined with) the definition of the API operations of
    the user-facing web-services. <br /> In Eucalyptus, we have 3 user-facing
    services which expose operations for controlling logical resources. These
    services and their related resources are depicted in the diagram to the
    right.
  </p>
  <p>The following things are important to understand when looking at the
    diagram:
  <ol>
    <li>The diagram depicts only top-level resource types -- it elides
      dependent attributes, i.e., anything which has a one-to-one relationship
      with a resource in terms of data and lifecycle.
    <li>The diagram depicts only resource types that are part of the
      logical model -- it elides important relatinships that result from the
      physical realization of the logical resource. For example, a volume
    <li>The cardinality relationships are varied (optional/required;
      many-to-many/one-to-one) and can have a direction (e.g., an image can be
      used by many instances, but an instance only uses one image).
    <li>Relationships span across the user-facing services -- e.g., image
      registrations (in the Cloud Controller) refer to objects (in Walrus).
  </ol>

  <h2 style="clear: both">The Information Model: Ground Truth & Physical
    Resources</h2>
  <img src="information-model.png" style="float: right;"
    title="Information Model" />
  <p>
    A fundamental architectural principle in Eucalyptus is that <em>ground
      truth</em> lives at the physical resource. What this means for the system is
    that services which manage a resource are run at (or as close as possible
    to) the resource. This has the benefit of focusing the service's purpose and
    interfaces, defining when the service is authoritative about system state,
    defining a narrow fault region, and dictates placement of the service in a
    system deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking to the logical model, it is clear that realizing such a model
    requires the interaction of physically distributed components to control
    things such as numerous compute hosts, network addressing, access, and
    border services, storage devices, etc. As an example, the logical
    <tt>instance</tt>
    resource defines a coordinated collection of boot resources, compute,
    networking, and storage -- it is <strong>not</strong> a virtual machine. The
    consequence in Eucalyptus is that services are co-located with and
    responsible for <em>ground truth</em> for resources and arbitrate
    interactions between such resources.
  </p>
  <p>We distinguish two roles of services in Eucalyptus:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>API</strong> services act as <i>ground-truth</i> for the
      logical model and are responsible for defining the logical resource,
      coordinating creation and changes to the physical instantiation along with
      the subsequent monitoring of its status.
    <li><strong>Resource Management</strong> services are the stewards of <i>ground-truth</i>
      for physical resources and are responsible for brokering access to use the
      resource and acting as the authority on the resource's state.
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Given that the physical world cannot be perfectly controlled, a
    consequence of this is that API services must interrogate Resource
    Management services and reconcile reality with the expectations of the
    current logical resource state. For example, an instance which had been
    previously run (and so was logically defined and then realized on a physical
    resource) may have failed for reasons which are outside the control paths of
    the system. Then, the reality is that the instance has failed and the
    Resource Management service is responsible for detecting that failure and
    exposing that information. Subsequently, the API services must be able to
    discover and correspondingly report the change in the logical view of the
    instance.</p>
  <p>As a result, Eucalyptus has a number of internal services for this
    purpose. Here is how they relate to the previously mentioned services:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cloud Controller:</strong> EC2 API service and operations
      needed to support instance deployments.
    <li><strong>Walrus:</strong> S3 API service and operations neeeded to
      support object storage.
    <li><strong>Cluster Controller:</strong> Backend service for private
      networking, dynamic address assignment, and arbitrator of compute resource
      allocation.
    <li><strong>Storage Controller:</strong> Backend service for volume
      operation and interactions like snapshot creation.
    <li><strong>Node Controller:</strong> Backend services need to support
      virtual machine operation and interactions like volume attachment, and
      private network access.
    <li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Instance</h3>
  The information related to the logical instance resource spans all components
  within the system. Fundamentally it can be broken down into those related to:
  bootstrapping the virtual machine, setting up networking (private and public),
  handling volume attachments, and bundling an instance.
